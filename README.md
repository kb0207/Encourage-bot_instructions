# **Instruction to use the Encourage Bot**

## Getting an encouraging quote from the bot

As the name suggests, this bot encourages the user. When the user types in `#inspire` (remember that "#" is activating the bot to respond to the user's typed-in command) and hit Enter, the bot responds to the command by giving a random encouraging quote every time the command is typed in and sent.


## Getting encouraging quotes on certain words

Well, let's say you are "sad" or "depressed" and you are tired of typing `#inspire` every time to get an encouraging quote, and want to get an encouraging quote anyway. Well, I have resolved that too: just type in words like `sad` or `depressed` or `unhappy` or `angry` or `miserable` or `depressing` and boom, the Encourage Bot responds to you with encouraging quotes that are limited but random. <br/>
But what if you had to add your encouraging quote? Well, I have found a [solution](https://github.com/kb0207/Encourage-bot_instructions/blob/main/README.md#adding-your-own-encouraging-quote) to that. <br/>

_(NOTE: This only works on some words that are stated above. I am working towards adding more relevant and suitable words to increase the accessibility of the bot.)_

## Adding your encouraging quote

Let's say you have got an amazing encouraging quote in your mind, but it's not gonna teleport it to the bot's code. Hence I have added another command for people to add their encouraging quotes. Just type in `#new` and `type your encouraging quote beside it` like this:- <br/>
`#new You are Amazing` and hit enter. This command has added a customized encouraging quote that says **You are amazing** when you write words like `angry` or `sad`. The bot will notify you when the quote is added to the list. 

## To view the list of added encouraging quotes 

To add more functionality and accessibility to the user, I have added an option of viewing the list of all added encouraging quotes. Just type in `#list` and you'll see the added encouraging quotes. <br/>
_(NOTE: These are manually added by the user and are not the ones which you get when you type `#inspire`)_

## Deleting an encouraging quote

Let's assume you added a wrong or misspelled encouraging quote and you want to delete it. Well, I have added another command to which the bot can respond by deleting the required quote. For this, you'll need to have the list of the quotes to see which quote of specified numbering _(Numbering starts with 0)_ has to be deleted as there might be many quotes already added. Go above to see how to [view the list of encouraging quotes](https://github.com/kb0207/Encourage-bot_instructions/blob/main/README.md#to-view-the-list-of-added-encouraging-quotes). Then type in `#del` and besides it, `add the number of the quote` from the list we just retrieved. Enter the command and boom! the quote of the designated number, from the list, is deleted by the bot. Here's an example for you to understand better:- <br/>
List is:
*(You are amazing, You are the best!, You will get through this phase)* <br/>
Numbering for the above list: *(0,1,2)* <br/>
**The numbering of the quotes starts with 0 (zero)** <br/>
Now assume you want to delete the quote *"You are the best!"* which is *"1"* as per the numbering.<br/> 
So to delete that quote, type - `#del 1` <br/>
and the quote- *"You are the best!"* is deleted from the list
<br/>

***For more accessibility, I will be adding more commands to the bot when I get free from my studies***
