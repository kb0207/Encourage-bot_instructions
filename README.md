## Getting an encouraging quote from the bot

As the name suggests, this bot, obviously, encourages the user. When the user types in `#inspire` (remember that "#" is activating the bot to repond to the user's typed in command) and hit Enter, the bot reponds to the command by giving a random encouraging quote everytime hte command is typed in and sent.
But what if you had to add your own encuraging statement? Well, I have found a [solution](./README.md#-adding-your-own-encouraging-quote) to that.

## Adding your own encouraging quote

Let's say you have got an amazing encouraging statement in your mind, but its not gonna teleport it to the bot's code. Hence I have added another command for people to add their own encouraging quote. Just type in `#add` and type your own encouraging quote besides it, and hit enter. The bot will notify you when the quote is added to the list.
